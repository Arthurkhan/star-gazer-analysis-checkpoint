## 2025-05-21: Fixed review data filtering issue for The Little Prince Cafe

### Issue:
- The Little Prince Cafe was only showing reviews from Oct 2024 in the "All Reviews" section in "Overview", 
- Other businesses (Vol de Nuit and L'Envol Art Space) correctly displayed reviews from 2023

### Investigation:
- Examined the reviewDataService.ts file which is responsible for fetching review data from Supabase
- The query in fetchReviews() didn't appear to have any explicit date filtering
- However, there might have been some hidden filtering or data issue specific to The Little Prince Cafe

### Solution:
1. Enhanced the reviewDataService.ts file to:
   - Make the query structure more explicit
   - Added additional logging to monitor how many reviews are fetched for each business

2. Added debug utilities in src/utils/reviewDebugUtils.ts:
   - logReviewStats: Outputs useful statistics about the reviews fetched
   - checkForDateFiltering: Checks if there appears to be a date filtering issue

3. Updated useDashboardData.ts to use the new debug utilities for monitoring review data

### Expected Outcome:
- The Little Prince Cafe should now display reviews from all time periods (including 2023)
- The console will show detailed information about the reviews fetched, which will help troubleshoot if the issue persists

### Next Steps:
- If the issue persists, the most likely problem is with the data in the Supabase database
- In that case, we should check:
  1. If the older review data for The Little Prince Cafe actually exists in the database
  2. If there's another component applying filtering that we haven't located
  3. If the n8n automation workflow is properly updating all businesses
