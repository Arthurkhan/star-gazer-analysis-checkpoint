## 2025-05-21: Fixed review data pagination issue for all businesses

### Issue:
- The dashboard was only showing 1000 reviews even though there are more available (1374 total)
- This was most noticeable with The Little Prince Cafe where it appeared to only show reviews from Oct 2024, missing the older reviews from 2023

### Investigation:
- Based on the screenshots provided, we confirmed the system was aware of the total 1374 reviews
- However, it was only loading the first 1000 reviews due to a pagination/limit issue
- This is why newer reviews (from Oct 2024) were visible but older ones weren't

### Solution:
1. Enhanced the `reviewDataService.ts` file to:
   - Get the total count of reviews first
   - Implement proper pagination to fetch ALL reviews in batches of 1000
   - Add detailed logging for each batch fetched

2. The solution fetches multiple batches of reviews and combines them, ensuring all reviews (including older ones from 2023) are loaded and displayed in the dashboard.

### Expected Outcome:
- All 1374 reviews should now load for each business, including older ones from 2023
- The console will show detailed information about each batch of reviews fetched
- The statistics in the dashboard will be more accurate as they'll be based on the complete dataset

### Next Steps:
- Verify that all reviews are loading correctly for all businesses
- Check the date range of reviews to confirm older reviews are now included
- Monitor the performance to ensure that loading all reviews doesn't cause significant slowdowns
